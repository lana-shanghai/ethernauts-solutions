## Coin Flip

After unsuccessful exercising in psychic readings, we see that each `side` actually is derived from the previous block number, which means that we can easily predict the result by applying the same formula. But when I sent the first few transactions manually, after reaching 5 correct guesses, I saw that my `consecutiveWins` dropped to 0. I attempted sending more transactions and kept running into the same problem. It was wildly frustrating, especially because I sent manual transactions and I was sure that my solution is correct because I got a bunch of guesses right. Anyway, after some time I realized that my transaction is sometimes mined in the `wrong` block, and so my guess, even though it was correct for the previous block, it was wrong for the one it was mined in. So I wrote a contract to mitigate that issue.  

## Telephone

Pretty trivial - you need to call the `changeOwner` function from your account address in your contract so that `msg.sender` does not equal `tx.origin` - hence the contract is needed. 

## Token

Dark times before we had SafeMath. Just by sending the current owner one more token than we own, we end up with a humongous amount of tokens. Happens because of the overflow - it works kind of like a clock, and if we rewind two hours back at one, it will be eleven o'clock. 
```
contract.transfer('current_owner', 21, {from:'your_address', to: 'your_instance_address'})
```

## Force

My favorite one. After a number of attempts I stopped trying to shove money to a contract with no payable fallback function and think for a bit. It helped! The way a contract can receive ethers besides a standard `send` or `transfer` is it can also receive a coinbase transaction or be the resolving addresses for a `selfdestruct` function. So I wrote a contract which had a payable `selfdestruct` function and sent myself some ether which triggered the destruction, and the funds were re-directed to my instance. I didn't attmept anything with the mining transactions.
